                    <p> Adding your module to Add Ons for indexing is as easy as creating a pull request!
                        Before we do that, we need to ensure that your module has been hosted on one of the sites that Add Ons currently supports indexing from: <br/>
                        a) Bintray <br/>
                        b) modules.openmrs.org <br/>
                    <br/>
                        Once you have confirmed the above prerequisite, you may head over to the <a target="_blank"
